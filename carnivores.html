    <h2>What are Carnivores?</h2>
    <p>Carnivores are creatures that primarily consume other creatures as a source of food. They are very humble creatures that prefer the delicacy that is other living things. By no means should you fear these rather timid and sizeable creatures as they are docile when startled. If you ever confront a living, breathing specimen, please remain calm and proceed to the nearest safe zone.</p>
    <h2> Fun Facts:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Your probability of survival is inversly proportional to the size of the creature you find before you.</li>
      <li> When presented with an option to fight or flee always choose the one that will impress your crush the most</li>
      <li> Never look a carnivorous dinosaur in the eyes, that will signal romantic interest with future intentions of marriage. This will likely provoke a recently promoted fiance.</li>
