    <h2>Our Cause:</h2>
    <p> To provide a renewed sense of imagination and wonder for the unbearably accurate history of our possibly chicken
      relatives. It is important to recognize the impact that these giants had on our ancestors and how immense time and
      resources have been devoted to reconstructing the past. While it may seem that dinosaurs have come and gone, there
      is much to learn about the extinction event that scholars are now calling the "KFC Value Bucket". </p>

    <h2>Our Contributions:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Reviewing publications that establish credibility for lizard like dinosaurs. Atleast the ugly ones.</li>
      <li>Started the petition to rename KFC to KFD to reflect important discoveries in evolutionary progression.</li>
      <li>Donated extra bones from excavation site to <a
