# LIS351 Website Accessibility 
This website was an assignment for LIS351: Introduction to Digital Information at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The assignment focuses on creating a basic website using HTML and CSS and experimenting with style and design choices to cater to a user base with a variety of accessibility needs. To enforce best practices websites were passed through an automated online accessibility checker which could detect shortcomings and offer improvements. Finally, the website was hosted through GitHub to grow familiarity with version control.
