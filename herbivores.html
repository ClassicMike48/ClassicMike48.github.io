      <h2>What are Herbivores?</h2>
      <p>Herbivores are the ancestors to vegetarians. They prefer to eat leafy plants that will provide them strength
        and nobility like the great Pop-eye the Sailor! Characteristics of herbivores include, but are not limited to:
        large spikes, tails, horns, and other unfriendly things with a point. As the saying goes, it is not easy being
        green, so do not tempt these simple yet dangerous creatures by disguising yourself as their most attractive
        snack!</p>
      <h2>Fun Facts!</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Green is their favorite food, and color. Its all really the same thing</li>
        <li><em>'Beefy Boys'</em> is not a proper nickname for these hostile giants. They prefer <em>'Large
            Legumes'</em></li>
        <li>Herbivores always eat their veggies first, since they don't care for the rest anyway.</li>
