    <h2>What are Herbivores?</h2>
    <p>Herbivores are the ancestors to vegetarians. They prefer to eat leafy plants that will provide them strength and nobility like the great Pop-eye the Sailor! Characteristics of herbivores include, but are not limited to: large spikes, tails, horns, and other unfriendly things with a point. As the saying goes, it is not easy being green, so do not tempt these simple yet dangerous creatures by disguising yourself as their most attractive snack!</p>
    <h2>Fun Facts!</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Green is their favorite food, and color. Its all really the same thing</li>
      <li><em>'Beefy Boys'</em> is not a proper nickname for these hostile giants. They prefer <em>'Large Legumes'</em></li>
      <li>Herbivores always eat their veggies first, since they don't care for the rest anyway.</li>
    </ul>
